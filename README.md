# LegalAI-RAG-ContractAdvisor
ContractAdvisorRAG: Development of a Q&A system with RAG using Langchain. This repository contains the code and documentation for building an AI-based legal assistance system for contracts. It includes retrieval and generation components, backend and frontend integration, as well as tools for evaluating and optimizing the RAG system using RAGAS.

**Motivation:**

- Efficiently answer questions about specific clauses and terms within contracts.
- Improve accessibility and understanding of legal documents for non-legal professionals.
- Explore the potential of RAG systems in legal applications.

**Objectives:**

* **Research:** Identify best practices and challenges in building and evaluating RAG systems.
* **Implementation:** Build a basic Q&A pipeline with Langchain and evaluate its performance.
* **Optimization:** Enhance the system with targeted improvements for legal document interaction.
* **Evaluation:** Measure the impact of optimizations and document the findings.

**Structure:**

* **Task 1: Research:** Literature review, analysis of performance metrics, investigating efficiency, and personalization.
* **Task 2: Building the system:** LLM selection, component design, retriever and generator development, integration and testing.
* **Task 3: Evaluation:** Setting metrics, defining benchmarks, implementing tools, and analyzing results.
* **Task 4: Optimization:** Identifying key areas for improvement, implementing selected enhancements, and evaluating their impact.
* **Task 5: Reporting:** Presenting findings in a clear and concise format.

**Key Findings:**

* The system demonstrates potential for Q&A in legal documents, but further optimization is required for accuracy and reliability.
* Targeted enhancements focusing on legal language understanding, precision, and data curation showed promising improvements.
* Collaboration between legal professionals and AI researchers is crucial for effective development and deployment of such systems.
