For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Agreement limits, restricts or in any other way affects any Seller’s communicating with any Governmental Authority, or communicating with any official or staff person of a Governmental Authority, concerning matters relevant to such Governmental Authority.\\n\\nPublicity.  No public announcement or disclosure (including any general announcement to employees, customers or suppliers) will be made by any party with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions without the prior written consent of the Buyer, the Company and the Sellers’ Representative; provided, that the provisions of this Section 6.06 shall not prohibit any disclosure (a) required by any applicable Legal Requirements (in which case the disclosing party will provide the other parties with the opportunity to review and comment in advance of such disclosure), (b) made in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, (c) by any party (or any Affiliate or member thereof) as part of such party’s (or its Affiliate’s or member’s) ordinary course reporting or review procedures or (d) by a Party to its Representatives, investors or prospective investors. Without limiting the foregoing,  the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that, following the public announcement of the Closing, institutional Company Securityholders shall be permitted to list, attach, append, refer to or otherwise use details of the names of the Acquired Companies, the nature of the Business, the existence of the Contemplated Transactions and identity of Buyer, and the fact of such Company Securityholders’ investment in the Acquired Companies in or to any marketing or publicity material (including on the website of such Company Securityholders).\\n\\nRelease. As a material inducement to the Buyer to enter into this Agreement, effective as of the Closing, each Seller, on behalf of itself, himself or herself; its, his or her past, present and future officers, directors, managers, equityholders, subsidiaries and other Affiliates; and each of their respective beneficiaries, heirs, dependents, Representatives, agents, predecessors, successors and assigns (collectively, the “Releasing Parties”) agrees not to sue, and fully releases and discharges the Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) and each of their respective directors, officers, assigns and successors, past and present (collectively, the “Releasees”), with respect to and from any and all claims, demands, rights, liens, contracts, covenants, actions, causes of action, obligations, debts, and losses of whatever kind or nature in law, equity or otherwise, whether now known or unknown, and whether or not concealed or hidden, all of which such Seller now own or hold or have at any time owned or held against the Releasees relating to or arising out of the operation or ownership of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.04 will be deemed to constitute a release by such Seller of any right to Compensation or any right to enforce their respective rights under this Agreement. It is the intention of each Seller that such release be effective as a bar to each and every claim, demand and cause of action hereinabove specified, except with respect to any right of such Seller to Compensation or any right to enforce their respective rights under this Agreement. In furtherance of this intention, each Seller hereby expressly waives, effective as of the Closing and subject to the exceptions set forth in this Section 6.07, any and all rights and benefits conferred upon such party by the provisions of applicable Legal Requirement, and expressly consents that this release will be given full force and effect according to each and all of its express terms and provisions, including those related to unknown and unsuspected claims, demands and causes of action, if any, as those relating to any other claims, demands and causes of action hereinabove specified, but only to the extent such section is applicable to releases such as this \\u200eSection 6.07.\\n\\nNonsolicitation. \\n\\n[Reserved]  \\n\\nFor a period of 12 months from and after the Closing Date (the “Restricted Period”), the Sellers shall not, and shall not permit, cause or encourage any of their Affiliates to, (i) solicit, lure or entice away, or in any other manner persuade or attempt to persuade, any Person who is an employee or consultant of any of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date to leave the employ of, or otherwise terminate or diminish his or her relationship with, any Acquired Company, provided, however, that this Agreement shall not prohibit soliciting the employment of any such individual whose employment has been terminated by the Acquired Companies; and provided, further, that the placement of advertisements in newspapers, online job boards, journals or other general circulations not directed or targeted to any such individual shall not constitute solicitation for purposes of this Section 6.08; or (ii) solicit or encourage any Person who is or has been a customer, vendor, supplier, or other business partner of any Acquired Company (each, a “Business Partner”), or any prospective Business Partner, as of the Closing Date to terminate or diminish its, his or her relationship with the Acquired Companies.  \\n\\nIf the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Section 6.08 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete or modify specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed. Further, each Seller agrees that, (i) were such Seller to breach any of the covenants contained in this Section 6.08, the damage to the Buyer and the Acquired Companies may be irreparable, (ii) the Buyer, in addition to any other remedies available to it, shall be entitled to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach by such Seller of any such covenants together with an award of its reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in enforcing its rights hereunder, (iii) the Restricted Period applicable to a Seller shall be tolled, and shall not run, during the period of any breach by such Seller of this Section 6.08, and (iv) no breach of any provision of this Agreement shall operate to extinguish a Seller’s obligation to comply with this Section 6.05.\\n\\nD&O Tail.  \\n\\nFrom and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Acquired Companies pursuant to any indemnification provisions under the Acquired Companies’ Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof and any indemnification agreement between an Acquired Company, on the one hand, and any of its current or former directors and officers (collectively, the “D&O Indemnitees”), on the other hand, with respect to acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time at or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions).\\n\\nThe Company shall obtain and fully pay the premium for “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies for the benefit of each Person who is currently covered by the Acquired Companies’ directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with an effective date no later than the Closing Date and with levels of coverage, terms and conditions that are at least as favorable to such Person as the directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies covering the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement. \\n\\nThis Section 6.09 shall survive the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and the Closing Date, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the D&O Indemnitees (or their heirs) and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the Acquired Companies.  If the Acquired Companies or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)\\xa0shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)\\xa0shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Acquired Companies shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.09.  Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, cooperate in good faith with the D&O Indemnitees to use the D&O tail policy with respect to claims relating to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing. The obligations of Buyer and the Company (following the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or its successors under this \\u200eSection 6.09 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any D&O Indemnitee (or his or her heirs) without the prior written consent of such D&O Indemnitee (or his or her heirs, as applicable).\\n\\n\\n\\n[Reserved]\\n\\n[Reserved]\\n\\n[Reserved]    \\n\\nFurther Assurances.  From and after the Closing Date, upon the request of either the Sellers’ Representative, the Buyer or any Acquired Company, each of the parties hereto shall do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further acts, assurances, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and other instruments and papers as may be reasonably required or appropriate to carry out the Contemplated Transactions.\\n\\nEmployees and Benefits; Retention Pool\\n\\nTo the extent that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility or vesting under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement (other than any defined benefit pension plan) established or maintained by Buyer or by the Acquired Companies following the Closing Date for the benefit of the Acquired Companies’ employees, such plan, program or arrangement shall credit, to the extent permitted, such Acquired Companies’ employees for service with the Acquired Companies on and prior to the Closing Date, except as would cause a duplication of benefits or coverage for the same period of service.  In addition, for the planned year in which the Closing occurs, with respect to any group health plan established or maintained by Buyer or by the Acquired Companies following the Closing Date for the benefit of Acquired Companies’ employees, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any pre-existing condition exclusions and (ii) provide that any covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by any Acquired Companies’ employee or by a covered dependent shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible coinsurance and maximum out of pocket provisions after the Closing Date.\\n\\nBuyer intends to offer each of the employees to be employed by Buyer or remain employees of the Company or the applicable Acquired Company after the Closing on terms that are, as of the Closing Date, no less favorable than the current terms of employment of each such employee.\\n\\nBuyer undertakes to pay or cause the Acquired Companies to pay certain employees identified on Exhibit 6.14(c) the retention bonuses set forth opposite each such employee’s name on Exhibit 6.14(c), in the aggregate amount of the Retention Amount, on terms set forth on Exhibit 6.14(c).\\n\\nParent undertakes to grant to each Vested Optionholder: (i) shares of Common Stock of Parent in such number as set forth opposite such Vested Optionholder’s name on the Allocation Statement. With respect to Vested Optionholders that are employed by the Israeli Subsidiary, such shares shall be granted under the capital gains route pursuant to Section 102; and (ii) options to acquire shares of Common Stock of Parent, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share, which shall vest monthly on a linear basis over a period of 24 months commencing as of the Closing. The number of options to be granted to each Vested Optionholder shall be in equal number (and will be in addition) to the number of shares granted to such Optionholder pursuant to Subsection 6.14(d)(i) above.  With respect to Vested Optionholders that are employed by the Israeli Subsidiary, the shares and options granted under this Section 6.14(d) shall be granted under the capital gains route pursuant to Section 102.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Reserved]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Reserved]\\n\\n\\nTAX MATTERS\\n\\nTax Sharing Agreements.  All Tax sharing agreements or similar Contractual Obligations and all powers of attorney with respect to or involving any Acquired Company are terminated effective as of the date hereof and the Acquired Companies will not be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder.\\n\\nCertain Taxes and Fees.  All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and any conveyance fees or recording charges incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions (“Transfer Taxes”) will be timely paid by Sellers when due.  The Sellers’ Representative will, at the expense of the Sellers, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable Legal Requirements, the Buyer will (and will cause their Affiliates to) join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. [internal – I think this is not applicable so I did not make any revisions].\\n\\nCooperation on Tax Matters.  The Buyer, the Acquired Companies, the Sellers’ Representatives and the Sellers will reasonably cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the Buyer, the Acquired Companies or the Sellers’ Representatives, in connection with any Tax matters relating to the Acquired Companies (including by the provision of reasonably relevant records or information).\\n\\nStraddle Period Allocation. For all purposes of this Agreement (including the calculation of Accrued Income Taxes), any Taxes of any Acquired Company for any Straddle Period shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period as follows: (i) the amount of any Taxes based upon or measured by income, gain, activities, events, receipts, proceeds, profits or other similar items for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period, respectively, shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business of the day immediately preceding  the Closing Date; and (ii) the amount of Taxes other than those described in clause (i) that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period and the remaining amount of such Taxes shall be allocated to the Post-Closing Tax Period (and for such purpose, the Taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity or controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957 of the Code) shall be deemed to end as of the Closing Date); provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation (other than with respect to property placed in service after the Closing), shall be apportioned on a daily basis and Taxes that are computed on a periodic basis, such as property Taxes shall also be apportioned on a daily basis. \\n\\nIntended U.S. Tax Treatment.

The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that are to be performed after the Closing will survive the Closing in accordance with their terms.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement (including in this \\u200eSection 10.01 or \\u200eSection 10.02) or otherwise to the contrary, nothing will limit or reduce Buyer’s ability to make claims or recover or receive any remedy from any Person with respect to claims arising from fraud committed by such Person.\\n\\nRecourse Limitations.\\n\\n \\n\\nOther than claims arising from fraud committed by the Person, no director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, partner, stockholder, shareholder, Affiliate, parent of, or holder of any equity interest in, any tier, agent, attorney or representative of the Company, Sellers or Buyer (each, a “Non-Party Affiliate”) shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) to any Person for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of (a) this Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby, (b) the negotiation or execution of or performance of any obligation under this Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby, (c) any breach or violation of this Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby or (d) any failure of the Contemplated Transactions to be consummated.  Non-Party Affiliates are expressly intended as third-party beneficiaries of this Section 8.02.

No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties (with the Sellers’ Representative acting for all of the Sellers), and any attempt to do so will be null and void ab initio; provided, that (a) the Buyer may assign this Agreement and any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates or designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder, in each case, so long as the Buyer is not relieved of any liability or obligations hereunder and (b) the Buyer may assign this Agreement and any or all of its rights and interest hereunder to any purchaser of all or substantially all its assets or designate such purchaser to perform its obligations hereunder.

No waiver by any party of any breach or violation of, default under or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, will be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent breach or violation of, default under, or inaccuracy in, any such representation, warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.  No delay or omission on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof.\\n\\nProvisions Concerning the Sellers’ Representative.\\n\\nAppointment.  Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints [●] as the sole and exclusive agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such Seller for all purposes of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, with full and exclusive power and authority to act on such Seller’s behalf (the “Sellers’ Representative”).  The appointment of the Sellers’ Representative hereunder is coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable and shall not be affected by the death, incapacity, insolvency, bankruptcy, illness or other inability to act of any Seller.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sellers’ Representative is hereby authorized, on behalf of the Sellers, to:\\n\\n\\t\\tin connection with the Closing, execute and receive all documents, instruments, certificates, statements and agreements on behalf of and in the name of each Seller necessary to effectuate the Closing and consummate the Contemplated Transactions;\\n\\n\\t\\treceive and give all notices and service of process, make all filings, enter into all Contractual Obligations, make all decisions, bring, prosecute, defend, settle, compromise or otherwise resolve all claims, disputes and Actions, authorize payments in respect of any such claims, disputes or Actions, and take all other actions, in each case, with respect to the matters set forth in Section 2.06, Article VII, Article VIII or any other Actions directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions;\\n\\n\\t\\treceive and give all notices, make all decisions and take all other actions on behalf of the Sellers in connection with the escrow account established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, including giving any instructions or authorizations to the Escrow Agent to pay from such escrow account any amounts owed by the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Contemplated Transactions;\\n\\n\\t\\texecute and deliver, should it elect to do so in its good faith discretion, on behalf of the Sellers, any amendment to, or waiver of, any term or provision of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, or any consent, acknowledgment or release relating to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; and\\n\\n\\t\\ttake all other actions permitted or required to be taken by or on behalf of the Sellers under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and exercise any and all rights that the Sellers or the Sellers’ Representative are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.\\n\\nLiability.  The Sellers’ Representative shall not be held liable by any of the Sellers for actions or omissions in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the power and authority of the Sellers’ Representative pursuant to this Agreement, except in the case of the Sellers’ Representative’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.  The Sellers’ Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts that it reasonably determines to be experienced in the matter at issue, and will not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith based on such advice.  Each Seller will severally (and not jointly) indemnify (in accordance with its Pro Rata Percentage) the Sellers’ Representative from any Losses arising out of its serving as the Sellers’ Representative hereunder, except for Losses arising out of or caused by the Sellers’ Representative’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.  The Sellers’ Representative is serving in its capacity as such solely for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not personally liable in such capacity for any of the obligations of the Sellers hereunder, and the Buyer agrees that it will not look to the personal assets of the Sellers’ Representative, acting in such capacity, for the satisfaction of any obligations to be performed by the Sellers hereunder.\\n\\nReliance on Appointment; Successor Sellers’ Representative.  The Buyer may rely on the appointment and authority of the Sellers’ Representative granted pursuant to this Section 11.04 until receipt of written notice of the appointment of a successor Sellers’ Representative made in accordance with this Section 11.04.  In so doing, the Buyer may rely on any and all actions taken by and decisions of the Sellers’ Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among any of the Sellers or the Sellers’ Representative with respect to any such action or decision without any Liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any Seller, the Sellers’ Representative or any other Person.  Any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers’ Representative shall constitute a decision of all the Sellers and shall be final and binding upon each of the Sellers.  At any time after the Closing, with or without cause, by a written instrument that is signed in writing by holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the Sellers (determined by reference to their respective Pro Rata Percentages) and delivered to Parent, the Sellers may remove and designate a successor Sellers’ Representative; provided, that such successor Sellers’ Representative must be reasonably acceptable to Parent.  If the Sellers’ Representative shall at any time resign or otherwise cease to function in its capacity as such for any reason whatsoever, and no successor that is reasonably acceptable to Parent is appointed by such holders of a majority-in-interest of the Sellers within ten (10) Business Days, then Parent shall have the right to appoint another Seller to act as the replacement Sellers’ Representative who shall serve as described in this Agreement and, under such circumstances, the Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any and all actions taken and decisions made by such replacement Sellers’ Representative.\\n\\nEntire Agreement.  This Agreement, together with the other Ancillary Agreements and any documents, instruments and certificates explicitly referred to herein, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto.

In the event that any provision hereof would, under applicable Legal Requirements, be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, each party hereto intends that such provision will be construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with, and possible under, applicable Legal Requirements.\\n\\nGoverning Law.

Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that, without posting a bond or other undertaking, the other parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or violations of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any Action instituted in any court of Israel or of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the parties and the matter in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity.  Each party further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach or violation, it will not assert that the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.\\n\\nWaiver of Jury Trial.

In so doing, the Buyer may rely on any and all actions taken by and decisions of the Sellers’ Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among any of the Sellers or the Sellers’ Representative with respect to any such action or decision without any Liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any Seller, the Sellers’ Representative or any other Person.  Any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers’ Representative shall constitute a decision of all the Sellers and shall be final and binding upon each of the Sellers.

If the Sellers’ Representative shall at any time resign or otherwise cease to function in its capacity as such for any reason whatsoever, and no successor that is reasonably acceptable to Parent is appointed by such holders of a majority-in-interest of the Sellers within ten (10) Business Days, then Parent shall have the right to appoint another Seller to act as the replacement Sellers’ Representative who shall serve as described in this Agreement and, under such circumstances, the Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any and all actions taken and decisions made by such replacement Sellers’ Representative.\\n\\nEntire Agreement.
